# Interview

Using the CRA template, create a single-page application that takes username and password from the user and sends it to a remote server.

When username and password are correct, take the token and get the number of tasks a user has.

Display that number with the last request processing time in milliseconds.

Use the `authenticate` mocked method to similate the server request.

Use the `getNumberOfTasks` mocked method to get the number of tasks.

The correct username/password pair is `username` and `password`.

Do not change the `utilities.ts` file.

Don't focus on:

- linting (it's configured and should be applied automatically in your IDE)
- the CSS
- the UX and look'n'feel of the single-page application

You might ask all the questions that are connected to the topic of the assignment but we will not provide answers on:

- JavaScript/TypeScript development,
- CS concepts, especially data structures,
- security concepts,
- design patterns,
- ReactJS mechanics.

From time to time, we might ask you questions to clarify what are you working on in the very moment.
